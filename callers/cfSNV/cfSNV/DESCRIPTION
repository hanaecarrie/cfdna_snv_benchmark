Description: cfSNV is an ultra-sensitive and accurate somatic SNV caller 
    designed for cfDNA sequencing. Taking advantage of modern statistical 
    models and machine learning approaches, cfSNV provides hierarchical 
    mutation profiling and multi-layer error suppression, including error 
    suppression in read mates, site-level error filtration and read-level 
    error filtration. cfSNV can be freely used for educational and research 
    purposes by non-profit institutions and U.S. government agencies only 
    under the UCLA Academic Software License. For information on the use 
    for a commercial purpose or by a commercial or for-profit entity, please 
    contact Prof. Xianghong Jasmine Zhou (https://zhoulab.dgsom.ucla.edu/).
